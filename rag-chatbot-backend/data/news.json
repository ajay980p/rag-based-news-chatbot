This marks a significant acceleration in adoption since its public launch. The growth has been primarily driven by the food and beverage and grocery categories, with increasing participation from small, local sellers in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. The ONDC aims to unbundle the e-commerce ecosystem, allowing any seller to be discoverable by any buyer, regardless of the app they use, thereby challenging the dominance of platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. While the transaction volume is still a small fraction of the overall e-commerce market, the rapid growth indicates that the open network model is gaining traction. The focus now is on improving seller onboarding, logistics integration, and expanding into new product categories like fashion and electronics.",
